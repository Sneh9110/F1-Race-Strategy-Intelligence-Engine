# Race Allocation Rules
allocation_rules:
  # Standard race weekend allocation
  standard_allocation:
    soft: 8  # Sets per driver
    medium: 3
    hard: 2
    intermediate: 4
    wet: 3

  # Compound selection by track type
  track_type_allocation:
    street_circuits:
      race_compounds: [C3, C4, C5]  # Softer compounds
      reason: Lower speeds, less degradation

    high_speed_circuits:
      race_compounds: [C1, C2, C3]  # Harder compounds
      reason: High energy, extreme degradation

    standard_circuits:
      race_compounds: [C2, C3, C4]  # Mixed compounds
      reason: Balanced characteristics

# Compound Strategy Guidelines
strategy_guidelines:
  one_stop:
    ideal_compounds: [MEDIUM, HARD]
    typical_stint_distribution: [50%, 50%]
    risk_level: LOW
    requires_conditions: [Low degradation, No safety cars]

  two_stop:
    ideal_compounds: [SOFT, MEDIUM, MEDIUM]
    typical_stint_distribution: [30%, 35%, 35%]
    risk_level: MEDIUM
    requires_conditions: [High degradation, Overtaking possible]

  three_stop:
    ideal_compounds: [SOFT, SOFT, MEDIUM, MEDIUM]
    typical_stint_distribution: [25%, 25%, 25%, 25%]
    risk_level: HIGH
    requires_conditions: [Very high degradation, Multiple safety cars]

# Temperature Effects
temperature_effects:
  track_temp_impact:
    cold_track_below_25c:
      effect: Harder compounds struggle to reach optimal temperature
      recommendation: Prefer softer compounds

    optimal_track_25_to_45c:
      effect: All compounds work as designed
      recommendation: Follow standard strategy

    hot_track_above_45c:
      effect: Softer compounds overheat and degrade faster
      recommendation: Prefer harder compounds, extend stints

  ambient_conditions:
    high_humidity_above_70:
      effect: Track cools faster, grip improves
      impact_on_degradation: -0.02  # Seconds per lap

    low_humidity_below_30:
      effect: Track heats up, increased wear
      impact_on_degradation: 0.03

# Compound Mixing Rules
mixing_rules:
  mandatory_compound_rule:
    dry_race: Must use at least TWO different slick compounds
    exceptions: Wet race (no compound requirement)

  optimal_mixing:
    soft_to_hard_jump: Not recommended (too large performance delta)
    preferred_progression: [SOFT->MEDIUM->HARD] or [MEDIUM->HARD]
    qualifying_to_race: Start on qualifying compound (Q2 tire rule)
